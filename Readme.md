# **Introduction**
The purpose of this challenge is to be able to successfully negotiate an array and use js code to manipulate the data within the array. It is important to appreciate that the array is not a simple linear one but one which has 86 arrays within. Each of these arrays represents a month with financial profit/losses.

## Method
In order to address this exercise successfully some of the properties of arrays used in The bootcamp were needed. These included
1. array.length

2. iterating through an array using a for loop

3. using array notation effectively to determine the locations of greatest increase and decrease in profits

4. concatenating strings and variables in the console to display the final result. 

Some of the methods not used in the bootcamp and needed research were:

1. sorting an array using array.sort() Appreciation of how this works requires an understanding that array.sort() requires a callback function and specifically for the array used in this exercise the need to use array indexes to iterate through the array to obtain the desired function

2. a better understanding of using operators to obtain the desired result in calculations. In this exercise the subtractoin assignment (-=) needed to be employed.
