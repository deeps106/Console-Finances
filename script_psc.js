// this challenge is about achieving the following:

// total number of months included in the dataset

// the net total amount of Profit/Losses over the entire period

// average of the **changes** in Profit/Losses over the entire period. You will need to track what the total change in profits are from month to month and then find the average.
//   * (`Total/Number of months`)

// The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period.

// the greatest decrease in losses (date and amount) over the entire period.

// When you open your code in the browser your resulting analysis should look similar to the following:

//   ```text
//   Financial Analysis
//   ----------------------------
//   Total Months: 25
//   Total: $2561231
//   Average  Change: $-2315.12
//   Greatest Increase in Profits: Feb-2012 ($1926159)
//   Greatest Decrease in Profits: Sep-2013 ($-2196167)
//   ```

// Your final code should print the analysis to the console.

// determine the toal number of months in dataset = to use an array
// the array could be month = [dataset = string]
// second array would be finances per month: monthlyFinances = [numbers]
// array position in month would need to correspond with that in monthlyFinances:

// month array[0] would correspond to monthlyFinances array[0].
// Need to find out how to link arrays - concatenate function NumPy function
