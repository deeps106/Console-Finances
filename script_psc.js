// this challenge is about achieving the following:

// total number of months included in the dataset

// the net total amount of Profit/Losses over the entire period

// average of the **changes** in Profit/Losses over the entire period. You will need to track what the total change in profits are from month to month and then find the average.
//   * (`Total/Number of months`)

// The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period.

// the greatest decrease in losses (date and amount) over the entire period.

// When you open your code in the browser your resulting analysis should look similar to the following:

//   ```text
//   Financial Analysis
//   ----------------------------
//   Total Months: 25
//   Total: $2561231
//   Average  Change: $-2315.12
//   Greatest Increase in Profits: Feb-2012 ($1926159)
//   Greatest Decrease in Profits: Sep-2013 ($-2196167)
//   ```

// Your final code should print the analysis to the console.

// determine the toal number of months in dataset = to use an array

// I will need to create 2 arrays to determine the total number of months in dataset
// and financial aspects - total amount of profit/losses over entire period, average change


// The Array

// With both arrays I can then  work out the increase and decrease of profits and losses (date and amount)


// the array is multi-dimensional so will need to create a multi-dimensional array:
// https://www.w3schools.com/java/java_arrays_multi.asp

// or if this doesn't work create two arrays


// Need to find out how to link arrays - concatenate function NumPy function
// https://www.w3schools.com/python/numpy/numpy_array_join.asp

// total months = total items in months array = .length.
// total amount of losses/profits = maths + function in array need to use + function for an array

// in order to display it options = console.log, alert or write  some lines in html to link with 
// js and perhaps do some CSS coding
